Mathematics and computer science class, Numerical computation 
-------------------------------------------------------------
In this class I had to use MATLAB to implement functions that I can test, given calculus and linear algebra formulas. Not only that but I had to 
make sure my code was written as efficient as possible. In this repo you will see me dealing with matrixes and having to use multiple theorems such as gauss 
elimination method and gauss Jordan method to make my code as efficient as possible solving equations.

Examples of the famous formulas written in MATLAB by me are, Horner's method, Regula Falsi method, Newtons method, and the secant method.
